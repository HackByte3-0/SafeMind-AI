## 🧠 SafeMind AI — Voice-Driven Mental Health Analysis with Cloudflare & Gemini API
SafeMind AI is a next-generation voice and text-powered mental well-being platform that uses cutting-edge AI to detect and monitor emotional states. Our goal is to provide individuals with a private and intelligent space to express themselves and gain meaningful insights into their mental health.

## 🌟 Overview
Mental health is a growing concern in the digital age, yet tools that help users reflect on their emotions are still limited. SafeMind AI bridges that gap using a combination of AI speech recognition, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis to analyze thoughts, feelings, and mood — all in real time.

Whether a user speaks out loud or types their emotions, SafeMind AI captures the data, processes it intelligently, and delivers clear, actionable feedback on their emotional trends.

## 🚀 Workflow Pipeline
User speaks or types their thoughts into the platform

Cloudflare AI processes speech input and converts it to structured text

Gemini API + NLP models analyze the text, identifying sentiment, tone, and keywords

The AI then generates insights, including:

Current emotional status

Past emotional pattern comparison

Suggested actions (e.g., journaling, meditation, reminders)

Data is stored and visualized on the user dashboard
